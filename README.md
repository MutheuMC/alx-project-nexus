# Job Board Application

## Overview
The Job Markets web Application is a modern web-based platform designed to help job seekers find employment opportunities and employers post job openings. The application features job listings, filtering, pagination, and a seamless user experience.

## Features
- **Job Listings**: Displays available job postings with details like title, location, company, and experience level.
- **Filtering**: Allows users to filter job postings based on criteria like company, job type, location, and experience level.
- **Pagination**: Ensures smooth navigation through multiple pages of job listings without refreshing the page.
- **User Authentication**: Enables users to sign in and manage their job postings.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React Hooks, Context API
- **Routing**:Next.js Link
- **API Integration**: RESTful APIs for fetching and managing job listings
- **Component Library**: Lucide React for icons
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js (if implemented)

## Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm or yarn

### Steps to Set Up the Project
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/job-board.git
   cd job-board
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```
3. **Configure environment variables**
   - Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory.
   - Add necessary environment variables (e.g., database URL, authentication secrets).

4. **Run the development server**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```
   The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage
- **Viewing Jobs**: Users can browse jobs, apply filters, and navigate through job pages using pagination.
- **Pagination**: The pagination component remains visible while jobs are being loaded.
- **Authentication**: Users can log in to manage job postings (if implemented).

## Challenges Faced
- Using TypeScript in an advanced project for the first time.
- Managing state for pagination while keeping UI elements persistent.
- Integrating filters and API calls efficiently without affecting performance.

## Future Improvements
- Add job application functionality for users.
- Implement real-time updates for job listings.
- Enhance the design for a more engaging user experience.
